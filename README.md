# TextAnalysis
A project that applies Natural Lanugage Processing techniques to determine whether texts of similar reading levels or grades have similar topics. This project uses text from books freely available from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). This project was created for MSDS 7337: Natural Language Processing by Noelle Brown.

* Language used: Python

#### Findings:  
Overall, there does not seem to be a strong relationship between topics and readability level/grade for the texts chosen. This was found based on TF-IDF and Bag of Words methods to determine topics along with the Dale-Chall readability formula to determine grade level.
